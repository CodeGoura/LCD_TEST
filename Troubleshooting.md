# Troubleshooting Guide

>> Troubleshooting Guide
If you encounter issues while running the LCD "Hello, World!" example, refer to the following troubleshooting guide for potential solutions.

1. Display Not Powering On
Solution:
Check the power connections.
Ensure that the VCC and GND connections are correct.
Confirm that the power supply provides the required voltage for the LCD display.
2. Incorrect Characters or No Text Displayed
Solution:
Verify the wiring connections.

Recheck the SCL and SDA connections between the microcontroller and the LCD display.
Ensure that there are no loose wires.
Confirm the code configuration.

Check the code for correct pin assignments (SCL_PIN and SDA_PIN).
Ensure that the LCD library and dependencies are properly installed.
3. Display Shows Blocks or Squares
Solution:
Check the contrast adjustment.

Some LCD displays have a potentiometer for contrast adjustment. Try adjusting it to improve the display visibility.
Confirm initialization in the code.

Ensure that the lcd.begin() function in the code is configured with the correct parameters for your LCD (e.g., columns and rows).
4. Nothing Happens When Uploading Code
Solution:
Check the COM port and board selection in the Arduino IDE or your development environment.

Ensure that the correct COM port and board are selected in the IDE.
Verify the USB cable and connection.

Ensure that the USB cable is securely connected between the microcontroller and your computer.
5. Serial Monitor Doesn't Show Output
Solution:
Check the baud rate in the Serial Monitor.

Ensure that the Serial Monitor is set to the same baud rate specified in the code (e.g., Serial.begin(9600)).
Verify the serial connection.

Confirm that the microcontroller is correctly connected to the computer.
Restart the Serial Monitor after uploading the code.
6. Code Compilation Errors
Solution:
Check for typos and syntax errors in the code.

Review the code for any errors or misspelled keywords.
Pay attention to parentheses, semicolons, and other syntax elements.
Ensure the LCD library is installed.

Confirm that the LCD library is properly installed in your development environment.
7. Unexpected Behavior
Solution:
Review the code logic.

Check the code for logical errors or unexpected behavior.
Ensure that the loop function (if used) is not causing unintended effects.
Debugging with Serial.print().

Use Serial.print() statements to debug and print intermediate values to the Serial Monitor for better understanding.
