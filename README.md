#LCD Display "Hello, World!" Example
Overview
This repository contains a simple example code for displaying the classic "Hello, World!" message on an LCD display. The example demonstrates how to interface with an LCD using a microcontroller or similar device and serves as a starting point for projects involving LCD displays.

Hardware Requirements
To run this example, you will need the following:

LCD Display: A standard alphanumeric LCD display, such as the commonly used 16x2 or 20x4 LCDs.

Microcontroller/Development Board: A microcontroller or development board with GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins. Examples include Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or any other microcontroller of your choice.

Jumper Wires: To connect the microcontroller to the LCD display.
#include <LCDLibrary.h>


// Define LCD pins
#define SCL_PIN 10
#define SDA_PIN 11

// Create LCD object
LCD lcd(SCL_PIN, SDA_PIN);

void setup() {
  // Initialize the LCD
  lcd.begin(16, 2); // Adjust the parameters based on your LCD specifications
  lcd.print("Hello, World!");
}

void loop() {
  // Your main code loop (if needed)
}

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Connect the hardware as per the wiring instructions in WIRING.md.
Upload the code to your microcontroller.
Open the serial monitor or any other interface to view the output.
The LCD should display the "Hello, World!" message.
Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different messages or formatting on the LCD display.

Wiring
Connect the LCD display to the microcontroller according to the wiring instructions provided in the WIRING.md file.

Troubleshooting
Refer to the TROUBLESHOOTING.md file for guidance on common issues and their solutions.
