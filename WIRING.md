# Wiring Instructions
Follow these instructions to correctly wire the LCD display to your microcontroller or development board.

>> LCD Display Pinout
Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the pinout of your LCD display. Commonly used LCD displays have pins for VCC, GND, SCL (Serial Clock), and SDA (Serial Data).

>> Here's a generic pinout example:

VCC: Connect to the 5V power supply.
GND: Connect to the ground of your microcontroller.
SCL (Serial Clock): Connect to a GPIO pin on your microcontroller.
SDA (Serial Data): Connect to another GPIO pin on your microcontroller.
Wiring Steps
Connect VCC and GND:

Connect the VCC pin on the LCD display to the 5V power supply on your microcontroller or development board.
Connect the GND pin on the LCD display to the ground (GND) on your microcontroller or development board.
Connect SCL and SDA:

Connect the SCL pin on the LCD display to a GPIO pin on your microcontroller.
Connect the SDA pin on the LCD display to another GPIO pin on your microcontroller.
Double-check Connections:

Ensure that all connections are secure and there are no loose wires.
Power Up:

Power up your microcontroller or development board.
Example Wiring
Here's a simple example using a generic LCD display with an Arduino:

LCD VCC to Arduino 5V
LCD GND to Arduino GND
LCD SCL to Arduino Digital Pin 10
LCD SDA to Arduino Digital Pin 11
Please adjust the connections based on your specific microcontroller and LCD display.

Additional Notes
Always refer to the datasheets of your specific components for accurate pin information.
If using a different microcontroller or display, adapt the connections accordingly.
Double-check the voltage requirements of your LCD display and ensure it matches the power supply voltage of your microcontroller.
These instructions should help you correctly wire the LCD display to your microcontroller for running the "Hello, World!" example. If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting guide or consult the documentation for your specific components.
